# finalfantasywiki.github.io

This is a area for JS tools to be used as a companion with the [Final Fantasy Wiki](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com). We have this on a separate site as custom JS is locked down pretty securely on the platform (despite the fact we've never had a major JS related breach on our site, yet some Genshin shipper managed to lock down the entire network once due to how insecure Fandom Dev is...) and doesn't work at all on mobile without getting every user to make their own user JS file, which is not a viable solution.

## Contributing

Anyone is free to open pull requests to add or change more, and staff will review. Staff that want to help review code can ask staff members that are part of the finalfantasywiki group for membership.

We're interested in anything that could assist people playing the games we cover. Puzzle solvers, easily usable charts for more complex abilities, anything that could be useful.

Please do not contribute code that you do not have rights to! We know that things added here will sometimes overlap with things that other people have already done, but we can't necessarily take those, as like the wiki proper, things you put here will be licensed CC BY-SA 3.0 (It has to be this way, as some of the code here is originally from the wiki). So either make sure your contributions are yours, or if you absolutely must, that they're of a compatible license. Similarly, if you're not okay with people editing your contributions, then do not contribute.
